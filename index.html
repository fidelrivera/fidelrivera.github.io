<p> Hi! My name is Fidel Rivera, and I am an undergraduate student Studying Information Management & Technology at Syracuse University!
<br>
<br> I was born and raised in Queens New York, and I am of Hispanic ethnicity. My mother and father were both born and raised in El Salvador.
<br>
<br> Some of my hobbies include playing basketball and a little bit of photography. The purpose of this website is to show my basic understanding of HTML through a GitHub website.
<br>
<br> Thank you for visiting! My other website is fidelrivera.weebly.com, which is used as more of a portfolio. I hope to grow this website into much more as I continue my education in the tech space! </p>
